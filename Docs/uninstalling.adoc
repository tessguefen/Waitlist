== Uninstalling the Module

To uninstall the module, you will need to make sure that the *waitlist* item and any *Scheduled Tasks* that are using the *Waitlist* scheduled tasks are fully removed.

Once these are both removed, navigate to *System Extension Settings*, and click on *Add/Remove Modules*.

Find *Waitlist* and uninstall.

The module will delete the Email template, but any custom logic templates must be manually deleted.
