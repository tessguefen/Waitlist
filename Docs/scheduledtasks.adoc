If you want your scheduled task to run after a product update, you can add the following fields to your scheduled task:

* Trigger: *waitlist_trigger*
* Trigger Delay: *60* second(s)

*Please Note:* Scheduled tasks with triggers will still run if in-active. This is important if you have development stores, or if you have processes in place that trigger many product updates, it will schedule the *Next Run* based on the trigger delay.
